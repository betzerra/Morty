# What this app does
It's just a tray app that gets information from my calenday and copies a text like this on the pasteboard:

```
27/05/2021
📞 12:00 - Dev Sync

28/05/2021
📞 13:00 - 1:1 Meeting with your manager
📞 14:00 - Interview with iOS candidate
📞 14:30 - Super secret meeting
```

This is very useful for me because I do standup meetings in Slack every day at work.

More features coming up soon!
